About this dataset:
*******************

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.
The UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce underâ€‘5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.
Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for 295 000 deaths during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). 
The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented.

In light of what was mentioned above, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. 
The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.
    

Data:
*****
This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:
1. Normal
2. Suspect
3. Pathological



The columns are described from the data source as follows:

    baseline value - Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) (beats per minute)
    accelerations - Number of accelerations per second
    fetal_movement - Number of fetal movements per second
    uterine_contractions - Number of uterine contractions per second
    light_decelerations - Number of light decelerations per second
    severe_decelerations - Number of severe decelerations per second
    prolongued_decelerations - Number of prolonged decelerations per second
    abnormal_short_term_variability - Percentage of time with abnormal short-term variability
    mean_value_of_short_term_variability - Mean value of short-term variability
    percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability - Percentage of time with abnormal long-term variability
    mean_value_of_long_term_variability - Mean value of long-term variability
    histogram_width - Width of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_min - Minimum of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_max - Maximum of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_number_of_peaks - Number of FHR histogram peaks (generated from exam)
    histogram_number_of_zeroes - Number of FHR histogram zeroes (generated from exam)
    histogram_mode - Mode of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_mean - Mean of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_median - Median of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_variance - Variance of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    histogram_tendency - Tendency of FHR histogram (generated from exam)
    fetal_health - Fetal health as assessed by expert obstetrician. 1 - Normal, 2 - Suspect, 3 - Pathological
